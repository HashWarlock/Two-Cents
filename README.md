Welcome to the cryptic writings that explore the depths of my creative freedom. As you roam the entangled paths of my understandings, know that I am honored to host your curiosity for this brief moment. This side expedition of mine will have errors in my knowledge, and I implore you to question all of my work for your own benefit. My goal is to explore the known unknowns to enhance my current interpretations of what I *know*.

    Met with the sand and fell to a knee.<br />
    Wonder of why waves that could be.<br />
    To look to the sky and wonder of thee."</em> <br />
