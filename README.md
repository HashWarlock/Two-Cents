Welcome to the cryptic accounts that explore the depths of my creative freedom. As you roam the entangled paths of my understandings, know that I am honored to host your curiosity for this brief moment. This side expedition of mine will have oddities throughout meant to obscure the traditional meaning of structure. May these energies permeate throughout and provide a new definition of *what the hxll is he talking about?*

> In the walls lies a dream of the sea
> Met with the sand and fell to a knee
> Wonder of why a wave that could be
> To see a star and wonder of thee
